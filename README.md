# Computational-lithography
This code is a python code with jupyter-lab environment. You can just copy and paste my code to run it, however, using jupyter-lab is recommended.
This is a 2D version of pierremifasol's work(https://github.com/pierremifasol/Lithography-Simulation) about computational lithography.
The file "Lithography Simulation with python.ipynb" and "Aberration and Defocus.ipynb" are almost exactly same code with above link "Lithography I - Basics" and "Lithography II - Aberrations and Defocus."
(I retype it for my personal studying, so minor mistypes could exist)


Dependencies

numpy
matplotlib
scikit-fmm
ipywidgets
scipy
IPython

    This file.

1. Lithography Simulation_2D.ipynb
    2D version of pierremifasol's code. Only Abbe's formula is implemented. I will update Hopkins' formula further and development process.
    At this code, there are 3 kind of mask(reticle), a hole, L shape and L shape with OPC.  

2. Lithography Simulation with python.ipynb
    same code with pierremifasol's code "Lithography I - Basics"

3. Aberration and Defocus.ipynb
    same code with pierremifasol's code"Lithography II - Aberrations and Defocus."
